##WooCommerce Subscribe to All the Things

WooCommerce Subscribe to All the Things is an experimental mini-extension for [WooCommerce Subscriptions](http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/).

The goal of the extension is to provide subscription support for non-subscription product types, allowing you to offer any product in your store as a subscription product.

For example, using this extens, you can offer a subscription product for the built-in WooCommerce Simple and Variable product types. It has also been tested and can be used to create a subscription product for extensions like [Composite Products](http://www.woothemes.com/products/composite-products/), [Product Bundles](http://www.woothemes.com/products/product-bundles/) and [Mix and Match Products](http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products/).
